OpenEBS Introduction
===================
OpenEBS is a cloud native storage solution built with the goal of providing containerized storage for containers. Using OpenEBS, a developer can seamlessly get the persistent storage for the stateful applications with ease, much of it is automated, while using the popular orchestration platforms such as kubernetes.

Persistent storage presents significant challenges to the developer interfacing with stateful applications such as databases. While a developer can get the initial needs of persistent storage using Docker volume plugin, kubernetes stateful sets etc, there is lots more to the storage needs of an application than just the connectivity. 

Note: In the current release, the integration support is provided for kubernetes only. 

Currently (OpenEBS 0.3 release), a DevOps developer gets the following from the OpenEBS solution

- OpenEBS operator yaml file that installs the OpenEBS components onto a k8s cluster
- A set of yaml files with example configuration of how to use OpenEBS storage classes 
- A cli tool called mayactl for monitoring the persistent volume and its replica(s)

Using the above tools, a developer can easily provision the persistent storage from the hostdir of the minion node. Much of the tasks for the developer are automated by the OpenEBS storage class,including, scheduling the volume and replicas on k8s minions, connectivity to the container via a mount point.

With OpenEBS 0.3, the application developer in k8s environment can provision the persistent storage volumes for the application and manage the data protection operations such as taking a snapshot and restoring to a snapshot etc.
